# MONGOOSE FLIGHTS

## INTRO
In this 3 part lab we dive into the fascinating world of CRUD APPS. Who would have thought there were so many apps that use CRUD? Certainly not me. In part 1 of this lab we dove into using express generator to create a mongoose-flights project. We made many things from models to creating a config/database. Part 2 of lab consisted of adding more user stories to dive deeper into the website. The goal of this lab is to add the ability to specify a list of destinations for the flight. In conclusion, we practiced embedding related data in the show view. Lastly part 3 had us reference a "ticketSchema" to create a 1:M relationship with the flights. Overall a long week of coding, but fun.
